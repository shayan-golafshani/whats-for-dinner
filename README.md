# What's for Dinner?

## Overview

Here lies a website that helps you think up what you should make when you get hungry. If you select a main entree, side, dessert, or even a whole meal.

If you click the let's cook button the pot will disappear and you will thus be able to get your list of items that you can cook for dinner.

## What I learned

I learned from this project that if you haven't found an answer after four hours of research, heck probably even one.... cut your losses and move on. I wanted to integrate in a nice login page that someone else had made, but I didn't know how to redirect a user once only, so I spent 4 hours trying to figure that out to no avail. In hindsight I would've stopped after the 30th google tag opened.

## Future considerations

In the future I really would like to learn how integrate other html files, how to redirect, and do so gracefully without being lost searching through so, so many tabs..... This is all the stamina I have left to write.
